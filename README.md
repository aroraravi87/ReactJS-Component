<p>React.js is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces</p>

<p>
React is a JavaScript library, but is often mistakenly referred to as a framework. Like many popular frameworks (Bootstrap, for example), React is all about reusable components. However, unlike frameworks, which are built with the goal of getting whole apps up and running quickly, the only thing you do with React is build components. As React.jsâ€™s core functionality, components make reusing code, testing, and separating concerns easy.

React has quite a small API. This makes it fun to use, easy to learn, and simple to understand. However, being simple does not mean it's familiar. There are a few concepts to cover before getting started. Let's look at each in turn.

<p>
React elements are JavaScript objects which represent HTML elements. They do not exist in the browser. They represent browser elements .
</p>
<p>
React is a library for building component based views. It doesn't concern itself with thing such as fetching data from the server or managing application logic. It is where the web is going on many levels. 
For instance frameworks like Angular and Ember try to solve many different aspects about all the elements of building web applications they are big and bulky and very opinionated. With Angular especially you will spend your time learning about things that aren't idiomatic to JavaScript and are specific to Angular that won't be useful in other libraries and frameworks.
The rising trend these days, especially with the emergence ES6, is writing more vanilla JS with the use of many smaller libraries that solve one single problem. With React that problem is DOM manipulation. 
I'm sick of hearing people say learn the ins and outs of JS before trying these libraries and frameworks. I agree that the theory is important but don't be afraid to get your hands dirty and build something and break stuff and fix it again. I have had UX/UI designers on my team that have got up and running with React in a matter of days with very basic knowledge of JavaScript. You will learn allot about JS from just reading React documentation and following tutorials.
Lastly, if you do choose to learn React and love it like most people do, next learn the Flux design pattern. It is an great way to build complete web applications with React. Do some tutorials implementing it in vanilla JavaScript first and then check out some of the many Flux frameworks like Fluxxor, Fluxible and Redux.
